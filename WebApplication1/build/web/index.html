                            Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales (also known 
                            as Pirates of the Caribbean: The Revenge of Salazar and Pirates 
                            of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge) is an upcoming American
                            fantasy swashbuckler film, and the fifth installment in the Pirates
                            of the Caribbean film series. The film is directed by Joachim 
                            Rønning and Espen Sandberg from a script by Jeff Nathanson, with
                            Jerry Bruckheimer serving again as producer. Johnny Depp, Geoffrey 
                            Rush, and Kevin McNally reprise their roles as Jack Sparrow, Hector
                            Barbossa, and Joshamee Gibbs, respectively. The film also stars 
                            Javier Bardem as Capitán Salazar, Brenton Thwaites as Henry, and
                            Kaya Scodelario as Carina Smyth. The film also features the return
                            of Orlando Bloom as Will Turner, following his absence from the
                            fourth installment, On Stranger Tides.

                            The filmmakers cited the first installment, The Curse of the Black
                            Pearl, as inspiration for the script and tone of the film.
                            Pre-production for the film started shortly before On Stranger
                            Tides was released in early 2011, with Terry Rossio writing a 
                            script for the film. In early 2013, Jeff Nathanson was hired to 
                            write a new script, with Depp being involved in Nathanson's writing
                            process. Initially planned for a 2015 release, the film was delayed 
                            to 2016 and then to 2017, due to script and budget issues. Principal 
                            photography started in Australia in February 2015, after the Australian
                            government offered Disney $20 million of tax incentives, and ended in 
                            July 2015. It is set to be released in conventional, Disney Digital 3-D, 
                            RealD 3D, and IMAX 3D formats on May 26, 2017.
