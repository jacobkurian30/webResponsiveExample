                           I have worked with I have only used HTML, CSS and angular in this lab. 
                           The CSS markup language help me to make my website looks better. 
                           And angular helps me to remove the unnecessary repetition of the same code.
                           I have used 3 CSS techniques in this lab. I have used transition for images,
                           gradient for header and footer background color and round corners for images.
                           I have learned many new things from this lab. I have learned how to use external 
                           CSS sheet. Also learned how to create 'HTML snippets' using angular. 
                           Moreover I learned new CSS techniques such as transition, gradient and rounded 
                           corners.
