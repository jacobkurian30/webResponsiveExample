                           I have a basic knowledge in html and CSS from high school. I have only used HTML, 
                           CSS and angular in this lab. The CSS markup language help me to make my website looks
                           better. And angular helps me to remove the unnecessary repetition of the same code.

                               I have used 3 CSS techniques in this lab. I have used transition for images,
                               gradient for header and footer background colors and round corners for images. 
                               The recommended size of image is below 50kb (by professor). But the size of the
                               title image is more than 50kb. It is because the picture will lose 
                               the quality if it is below 50kb.

                               This lab help me to learn many new things. I have learned how to use external 
                               CSS sheet. Also learned how to create 'HTML snippets' using angular. Moreover
                               I learned new CSS techniques such as transition, gradient and rounded corners.
